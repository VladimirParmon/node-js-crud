This is a simple CRUD server based on vanilla NODE JS  
It has only one route, which is "users"

To run the server:
- in development mode: `npm run start:dev` (uses nodemon and ts-node);
- in production mode: `npm run start:prod` (compiles a bundle using webpack and runs the server).

To test the server (PUT, POST) please send data as a **JSON string**.  
Sample payload:
  ```
  {
    "username": "Pablo",
    "age": 23,
    "hobbies": ["kittens", "sport"],
  }
  ```
  All fields are requried.
  ```
      username: string;
      age: number;
      hobbies: string[];
  ```
  To test the server (GET, DELETE) insert user ID in the query string:  
  `http://127.0.0.1:3000/api/users/6ec0bd7f-11c0-43da-975e-2a8ad9ebae0a`
